# Perceptrons
In this repo I have shown how the Perceptron Learning Algorithm for 2D and 3D datapoints.

This repo also includes a "Books Dataset" where the datapoins are linearly seperable.

I have also included and approximate perceptron learning algorithm for non linearly seperable 2D datapoints.

The contents of this repo are:

1.) Approximate Perceptron 2D
2.) Multilayer Network of Perceptrons
3.) Perceptron 2D
4.) Perceptron 3D
5.) Books Dataset
